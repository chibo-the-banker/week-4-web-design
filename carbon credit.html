      <h1 id="heading1">Chapter 1: The Carbon Market Awakening</h1>
      In the year 2025, as climate change intensified, the world turned to
      carbon credits—a system where every ton of CO₂ reduced or removed from the
      atmosphere became a tradable asset. Governments, corporations, and even
      individuals could now earn money by going green.

      <h1 id="heading2">Chapter 2: What Are Carbon Credits?</h1>
      A carbon credit (1 credit = 1 ton of CO₂) is a permit that allows the
      holder to emit a certain amount of carbon. Companies buy them to offset
      their emissions, while individuals and projects that reduce emissions can
      sell them for profit.

      <h2>How Individuals Can Earn from Carbon Credits</h2>
      1. Generate Carbon Credits (Become a "Carbon Farmer") Individuals can earn
      credits by:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Planting Trees – Forests absorb CO₂. Organizations like Verra and Gold
          Standard certify reforestation projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Switching to Clean Energy – Solar panels, biogas, and wind turbines
          reduce fossil fuel use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sustainable Farming – Methods like no-till agriculture trap CO₂ in
          soil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Waste-to-Energy Projects – Turning organic waste into biogas earns
          credits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      2. Sell Credits on Carbon Markets Once certified, individuals can sell
      credits on:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Voluntary Markets (e.g., CarbonTrade, Pachama) – Buyers include
          eco-conscious companies like Microsoft and Tesla.
        </li>
        <li>
          Compliance Markets (e.g., EU Emissions Trading System) – Governments
          and big polluters buy to meet legal limits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      3. Invest in Carbon Credit Funds For those who don’t produce credits,
      carbon ETFs (e.g., KRBN, GRN) allow investment in rising credit prices.
      How to Use Carbon Credits Offset Personal Emissions – Travel, energy use,
      and lifestyle can be "neutralized" by buying credits. Sell for Profit –
      Hold credits as their value rises (like stocks) and sell when prices peak.
      Support Green Projects – Donate credits to conservation initiatives for
      tax benefits. Top Carbon Credit Issuers Issuer Focus How to Participate
      Verra Reforestation, Renewable Energy Register projects, get audited Gold
      Standard Clean Cookstoves, Solar Submit sustainability plans Pachama
      AI-monitored Forests Sell credits via their marketplace South Pole
      Corporate Offsetting Partner with their carbon programs
      <h1 id="heading3">Chapter 3: The Rise of the Carbon Entrepreneur</h1>
      Meet Sarah, a Kenyan farmer who switched to solar irrigation. After Verra
      certified her farm, she sold 500 credits at 20 each earning
      20each—earning10,000 yearly. Meanwhile, Mark, a U.S. investor, bought
      carbon futures and doubled his money in 2 years. Final Word Carbon credits
      turn climate action into income. Whether you’re a farmer, homeowner, or
      investor, the green economy pays—if you know how to play the game.
